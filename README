Doppelganger by Niluje
----------------------

*** Acknowelegemnt ***

Shamelessy stolen from:

Vasco puf:  https://github.com/pgaufillet/vasco for the toolchain installation makefile
Pinguino:  http://pinguino.cc for the bootloader and some compilation scripts
m-stack:  for the USB framework
toodle: for the MC-Cthulu and the UPCB and ... the main idea !

Installation
------------

1) toolchain install

cd archives
make

2) bootloader compilation

cd bootloader
make clean && make

The resulting file is named Doppelganger_Bootloader_v0.1.0_SDCC_18f45k50_INTOSC.hex.
You can write it into the the PIC using any programmer you want.

Onced flashed, the Doppelganger will boot in bootloader mode (signaled by a
LED-R blinking at a fast rate). In this mode, the Doppelganger can be seen from
the PC (through USB) as USB device (VID=0x1807, PID=0x55AA).

3) application compilation

cd application
make clean && make

The resulting file is named Doppelganger.hex and is available in the hex
directory.
