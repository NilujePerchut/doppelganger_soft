# Doppelganger RevA0
_Niluje (c) 2016_

Joystick interface to old video game systems.

## Acknowelegement

Shamelessy stolen from:

* Pierre Gaufillet for the [Vasco PUF](https://github.com/pgaufillet/vasco), for the toolchain installation makefile.
* Regis Blanchot for the [Pinguino](http://pinguino.cc) for the bootloader and some compilation scripts
* Alan Ott for the [M-Stack](http://www.signal11.us/oss/m-stack/) USB framework
* Toodle for the [MC-Cthulu](http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/46572/the-official-cthulhu-and-chimp-thread-try-our-new-dreamcast-flavor), the UPCB and ... the main idea !
* Fluxcorenz: for the [UPCB](https://github.com/fluxcorenz/UPCB) on github

I tried (as much as possible) to mentioned the inspiration source in each source file header.

## Installion

See the INSTALL.md file in the same directory.

## Licence

Since Doppelganger is built on the top of several projects with different licenses, I choosed what seems to be the only compatible solution : GPLV3. This choice was made according to the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility). If any of the original authors does not agree with that choice, please contact me: debarge.cedric AT gmail.com.
